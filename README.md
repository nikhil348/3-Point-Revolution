# 3-Point Revolution
A gif that I made using the ggplot and gganimate libraries that shows how dramatically teams have increased their 3-point shooting throughout the years. Made in September 2018 for the blog section of our website: http://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/blog/

Please note that the team labels are updated as of the 2017-18 season; thus, teams that have changed names over the years correspond to the labels of the current name of the team. For example, the Vancouver Grizzlies are represented by the Memphis Grizzlies, the Charlotte Bobcats are represented by the Charlotte Hornets, etc.
